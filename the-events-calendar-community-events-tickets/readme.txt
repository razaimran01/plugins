Community Tickets extends the functionality of Modern Tribe's The Events Calendar (http://m.tri.be/3j), Community Events, Event Tickets, and Tickets Plus to allow for frontend event submission with tickets on your WordPress site.

All of our online documentation can be found on <a href="http://m.tri.be/eu">our documentation site</a>.

Some docs you may find particularly useful are:

* <a href="http://m.tri.be/18l-">New User Primer: Community Tickets</a>
* <a href="http://m.tri.be/18m1">Configuring Community Tickets</a>
* <a href="http://m.tri.be/18m0">Community Tickets: Tracking sales & getting paid</a>

= Shortcodes =

Community Tickets is fully integrated with Community Events shortcodes: if you are using the [tribe_community_events] shortcode to display the CE submission form on posts and pages, your users will also be able to create new tickets using it.

To display the Attendees Report for a specific event use:

[tribe_community_tickets view="attendees_report" id="your_event_id"]

To display the Sales Report for a specific event use:

[tribe_community_tickets view="sales_report" id="your_event_id"]

PS: Don't forget to replace "your_event_id" with the relevant event ID.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question? =

Please visit the forum for questions or comments: http://m.tri.be/18ku

= Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread? =

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of The Events Calendar, Community Tickets, Event Tickets, and Tickets Plus. If you've got any other add-ons, make sure those are current / running the latest code as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin or theme conflicts. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just The Events Calendar is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fifteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict.

Note that we aren't going to say "tough luck" if you identify a plugin/theme conflict. While we can't guarantee 100% integration with any plugin or theme out there, we will do our best (and reach out the plugin/theme author as needed) to figure out a solution that benefits everyone.

= I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question? =

If you're a Community Tickets user, you're entitled access to our actively-monitored <a href="http://m.tri.be/3x">forums</a> at the theeventscalendar.com website. We can provide a deeper level of support here and hit these forums on a daily basis during the work week. You will receive a reply within 24-48 hours (during the week).
